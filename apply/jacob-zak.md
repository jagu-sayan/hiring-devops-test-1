Hello [@arkan](https://github.com/arkan) and [@Rohja](https://github.com/Rohja),

I invited you to https://github.com/jagu-sayan/hiring-devops-test

I explain my choices [here](https://github.com/jagu-sayan/hiring-devops-test/blob/main/infra/README.md)

I am not sure to understand why we need a pull request ? But well, I made one.

I learn WebRTC and WebSocket with this project, I hope you will enjoy :)
